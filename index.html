                        make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                        signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                        Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                        Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                        encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                        things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
